### Important notes on MySQL support

#### Security warning

Be sure to first read and understand the [security implications](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data-local.html) of `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`. In particular, having this enabled on a web app is probably not a good idea.

#### v0.9.5

v0.9.5 will always use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` for bulk load - this is not configurable.

#### v1.0.0.rc1

This version should by default use `LOAD DATA INFILE` for safer defaults.

You can override this by passing `:local_infile => true` though.

#### Troubleshooting LOCAL INFILE

If you enable `:local_infile => true` and meet the following error, then you'll have to work it around.

```
The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version: LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
```

For mysql2 with AR >= 3.1:

- use [this fork](https://github.com/activewarehouse/mysql2) until [this pull-request](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/pull/242) is merged 
- add `local_infile: true` to your database.yml

For mysql2 with AR < 3.1:

- no current easy solution afaik

For mysql:

- try this [untested patch](https://github.com/activewarehouse/adapter_extensions/issues/7)

### Notes on SQLServer support

v0.9.5 had a broken support for SQLServer.

v1.0.0.rc1 has a work-in-progress bulk import using `freebcp`. More tweaking needed.

### Running the tests

You may have to tweak the Rakefile and database.yml a bit, but roughly:

```
rake ci:create_db
rake "ci:run_one[mysql2,test/config/gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.2.x]"
```

You can also run a matrix of tests using:

```
rake ci:run_matrix
```
